# physics_books
Theoretical books on QFT, QM, Astrophysics, Compact Objects for starting in these fields. I'll be making subparts of this where all the books will be divided based upon the course type and level of study required.

# Mathematics books 
Mathematics books that are really essential to the understanding of the physics. It is really important to understand the "math" before one can understand the hiding physics behind.

# Software to open the books
Some of these contains are in pdf, while some are in the djvu format. Both formats are openable in Linux(ubuntu) text viewer/ pdf viewer. I'm not sure in windows. While in androids, you can download DJVU reader from playstore, it handles both the formats.
